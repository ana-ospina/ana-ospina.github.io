I'm a Ph.D. student in the Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering Departament at CU Boulder working under the supervision of Prof. Emiliano Dall'Anese. I received a B.S. Degrees in Electronic and Electrical Engineering in 2011 and a M.S. Degree in Electrical Engineering in 2014, from University of Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia. I was a Specialized Engineer at the National Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME), Colombia. 

My research interests are online optimization and learning, with applications in power and energy systems.

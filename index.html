        I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering Department at CU Boulder working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/dallanese/" target="_blank">Prof. Emiliano Dall'Anese</a>. I received B.S. Degrees in Electronic and Electrical Engineering in 2011 and a M.S. Degree in Electrical Engineering in 2014, from University of Los Andes, Bogot&aacute, Colombia. I was a Specialized Engineer at the National Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME), Colombia. 

        My research interests are online optimization and learning, with applications in power and energy systems.
